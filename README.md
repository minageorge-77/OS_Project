# OS_Project
This is an implementation of "Priority Scheduling (Preemitive)" Algorithm {Operating System Project}

I implemented an scheduling algorithms simulation with JavaScript programming language. 
• GUI is a Front-End Page (Html & Css), and Gantt Chart is provided. 
• Number of processes is user defined (i.e. user enters them at run 
time).  
• All process data (i.e. process arrival time, burst time) is user defined. 
• Validation for the input data is considered and Tested (i.e. can’t enter negative 
numbers, or characters in the input fields).  
• Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, and Response Time for each process is calculated.  
• Average Waiting Time, Average Turnaround Time, and Average Response Time is also calculated.  
 
Scheduling Algorithm: Priority (Preemptive).
Thank You..
